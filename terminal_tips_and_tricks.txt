ctrl + c : ignores the current line's input
        Example:
        having pythno3 main.py and running ctrl+c will just ignore the line and create a new line as if it were commented out

open -e filename: opens a file with the textedit program
        Example:
        open -e file.txt
        open -e /Users/nikhil/Documents/file.txt

If any command needs a file as an input, you can use .. to go 1 directory above, or use the full directory path
        Example:
        open -e file.txt
        open -e ../file.txt
        open -e ../../file.txt # this goes up two directories

man : shows the manual pages for any command
        Example:
        man python3
        man open
